# Task Manager Project

Welcome to the `Task Manager`, a Python command-line application designed to create, organize, and manage tasks effectively. This project interacts with Google Sheets to store and process data, making it both powerful and dynamic. The last update to this file was: `March 13, 2025.`

## OOP aproach vs procedural approach

The Task Manager application was initially written according to procedural approach but later transitioned to an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach to improve scalability, maintainability, and organization of the code. OOP enables better modularity by encapsulating task management, validation, and data handling into reusable classes and methods. This structure also aligns with modern best practices, making the application easier to expand and debug.

### What About the Procedural Code?

The original procedural version is preserved in the run_old.py module for reference. While no longer maintained, it offers a snapshot of the initial design and serves as a comparison for the benefits of OOP.

## Features

* **Task Management:**
  * Add, update, delete, view, and archive tasks.
  * Mark tasks as completed and sort them by deadlines, priority, or category.
* **Google Sheets Integration:**
  * Tasks, categories, and projects are synchronized in real-time with a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
* **Caching for Improved Performance:**
  * Google Sheets data is loaded and cached locally in memory to optimize performance and reduce API calls, ensuring smooth operation even under quota restrictions.
* **Colorized Console Output:**
  * Visually enhanced task lists with color-coded priorities and headers for better readability:
    * _High Priority_: Red background
    * _Medium Priority_: Pink background
    * _Low Priority_: Green background
    * _Empty Priority_: Gray background
    * Underlined headers

## Caching Google Sheets Data

To improve performance and reduce API quota consumption, the application now caches data from the **tasks**, **categories**, and **projects** worksheets during initialization. Cached data is stored in memory and reused throughout the application, minimizing redundant API calls.

### Implementation

* Data is fetched and cached at the start using the load_and_cache_data() method within the TaskManager class.
* Cached attributes:
  * self.cached_tasks
  * self.cached_projects
  * self.cached_categories
* All operations (e.g., adding, updating, or retrieving tasks, projects, and categories) access these cached attributes instead of making direct calls to the Google Sheets API.

### Benefits

* **Performance Boost**: Faster data retrieval and processing.
* **Quota Preservation**: Avoids exceeding Google Sheets API limits due to redundant calls.

## Colorized Console Output

The application uses the colorama library to add color to text and improve readability in the terminal. Priority levels and headers are visually distinguished by colors.

### Color Coding

* **Priority**:
  * _High_: Red background
  * _Medium_: Pink background
  * _Low_: Green background
  * _Empty Priority_: Gray background
* **Headers**: Underlined and displayed in blue for clarity.

### Example

ID    Deadline     Priority   Status       Project                 Name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1     2025-03-25  High        Pending      Client A:               Urgent Meeting
2     2025-03-30  Medium      In Progress Internal:                Code Review
3     2025-04-05  Low         Completed    Client B:               Documentation
4     2025-04-10               Pending      Internal:               Research

### Technical Details

* Colorized output is achieved using the colorama library:
  * _Fore_: Sets text colors (e.g., white for task names).
  * _Back_: Highlights text with background colors for priorities.
  * _Style_: Applies formatting like bold or underlined headers.

## Reminders

* Code Placement: Your code should reside in the `run.py` file.
* Dependencies: Include all required dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
* Google Sheets API Setup: Configure the connection to Google Sheets by adding the necessary credentials in your environment variables.
* Data Validation: Built-in validation ensures accurate and clean data input.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to Heroku, follow these steps:

**1. Set Up Your Heroku Environment:**

* Create a new Heroku app.
* Go to the _Settings_ tab of your Heroku app.
* Add the following buildpacks in this order:
  * `heroku/python`
  * `heroku/nodejs`

**2. Set Config Vars:**

* Add a Config Var called `PORT` and set it to `8000`.
* If you use Google Sheets credentials, add another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the `JSON` credentials into the value field.

**3. Prepare Your Repository:**

* Ensure your code is properly committed to a _GitHub_ repository.
* Your main script file must be named run.py.
* Include a requirements.txt file listing all your dependencies.

**4. Connect Heroku to GitHub:**

* Under the Deploy tab in Heroku, connect your _GitHub_ repository.
* Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main).

**5. Deploy the Application:**

* Click on `Deploy Branch` in the _Heroku_ dashboard.
* Once deployed, your application can be accessed here.

**6. Test Your Application:**

* Make sure all features are functional in the deployed environment.
* Verify your integration with Google Sheets works as intended.

## Using the Task Manager

The Task Manager application allows users to manage tasks, projects, and categories seamlessly while interacting with data stored in Google Sheets. Here's how to navigate and use the system effectively:

### Main Menu

Upon launching the application, you will see a main menu with several options. Each option corresponds to a specific task management operation. Simply enter the number of the desired option to proceed.

### Key Features

1. View Tasks:
    * Displays a list of all tasks in a table format.
    * Tasks are color-coded by priority for better readability:
      * High Priority: Red background
      * Medium Priority: Pink background
      * Low Priority: Green background
      * Empty Priority: Gray background
    * Headers are underlined for clarity.

2. Add a Task:
    * Create a new task with details like name, deadline, priority, status, category, and project.
    * Newly added tasks are stored in Google Sheets and immediately cached for optimized performance.

3. Update a Task:
    * Modify existing tasks by editing attributes such as name, deadline, priority, status, notes, category, and project.
    * Updates are reflected in both the Google Sheets and the cached data.

4. Delete a Task:
    * Remove tasks permanently or archive them to the "deleted" tab in Google Sheets.

5. View Tasks by Filters:
    * Filter and display tasks by priority, category, or project.
    * Color-coded output makes identifying tasks effortless.

6. Caching for Speed:
    * Upon starting the application, Google Sheets data is cached to reduce API calls and improve performance.
    * Cached data includes tasks, projects, and categories, making repeated operations faster.

7. Enhanced Console Output:
    * Headers, tasks, and priorities are formatted with colors and underlining for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

### How to Navigate

1. Select an Option:
    * Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation from the menu.
    * Follow the prompts to enter the required information (e.g., task details or filter criteria).

2. Color Indicators:
    * Watch for colored text or backgrounds to quickly identify priorities:
    * Example: High-priority tasks will have a bold red background.

3. Validation:
    * The program will validate inputs like category and project IDs to ensure accuracy.
    * Invalid inputs are flagged with error messages.

4. Real-Time Google Sheets Sync:
    * All changes are immediately synchronized with the Google Sheets file, ensuring your data is always up-to-date.

## Project Constraints

The command-line interface is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. Ensure all outputs stay within these constraints for better readability.

## Requirements

To run this project, youâ€™ll need:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Required libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Google Sheets credentials for API integration
* **colorama Library**: Install the `colorama` library using:
  * bash:
  * `pip install colorama`

## How It Works

This application uses the Google Sheets API to store and organize task data:

* Tasks Tab: Contains all active tasks.
* Completed Tab: Stores completed tasks.
* Deleted Tab: Archives deleted tasks for future reference.
* Projects & Categories Tabs: Used for validation when assigning projects and categories to tasks.

**Happy Coding!**

We hope this task manager helps simplify your workflow and improves productivity.
