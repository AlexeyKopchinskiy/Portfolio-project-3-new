## Scope of classes & functions 

- **"Task" Class:** Represents an individual task, including attributes like **deadline, priority, status, and notes**.
- **"TaskManager" Class:** Handles task operations such as **loading, caching, validation, and synchronization** with Google Sheets.
- **Google Sheets API:** Enables the program to **fetch, store, and update** task-related data seamlessly.
- **Task Operations:** `add_task()`, `update_task()`, `delete_task()`, `mark_task_completed()`
- **Data Management:** `load_tasks()`, `load_and_cache_data()`, `generate_unique_task_id()`
- **Validation Methods:** Ensure proper **task name, deadline, priority, and category/project selection**.
- **Console Display:** Tasks can be viewed in an **organized table format**, sorted by **priority, deadline, or status**.

### Caching Google Sheets Data

To improve performance and reduce API quota consumption, the application now caches data from the **tasks**, **categories**, and **projects** worksheets during initialization. Cached data is stored in memory and reused throughout the application, minimizing redundant API calls.

**Implementation**

* Data is fetched and cached at the start using the load_and_cache_data() method within the TaskManager class.
* Cached attributes:
  * self.cached_tasks
  * self.cached_projects
  * self.cached_categories
* All operations (e.g., adding, updating, or retrieving tasks, projects, and categories) access these cached attributes instead of making direct calls to the Google Sheets API.

### Colorized Console Output

The application uses the colorama library to add color to text and improve readability in the terminal. Priority levels and headers are visually distinguished by colors.

**Color Coding**

![Colred code](assets/4_colorised_code.png)

* **Priority**:
  * _High_: Red background
  * _Medium_: Pink background
  * _Low_: Green background
  * _Empty Priority_: Gray background
* **Headers**: Underlined and displayed in blue for clarity.

**Technical Details**

* Colorized output is achieved using the colorama library:
  * _Fore_: Sets text colors (e.g., white for task names).
  * _Back_: Highlights text with background colors for priorities.
  * _Style_: Applies formatting like bold or underlined headers.

## Reminders

* Code Placement: Your code should reside in the `run.py` file.
* Dependencies: Include all required dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
* Google Sheets API Setup: Configure the connection to Google Sheets by adding the necessary credentials in your environment variables.
* Data Validation: Built-in validation ensures accurate and clean data input.

## Testing

To ensure the Task Manager application works seamlessly, it's essential to validate its functionality through rigorous testing. Below is an outline of testing practices for various features and a note on input validation:

![Testing-main-menu](assets/3_data_input_validation_1.png)

### 1. Testing Core Features

![Testing-main-menu](assets/3_data_input_validation_2.png)

* **Task Creation**: Test adding new tasks with valid and invalid data (e.g., empty task names, deadlines in the past).
* **Task Updates**: Check all updatable fields (e.g., name, deadline, priority, notes) for correct behavior.
* **Task Deletion**: Verify that deleting tasks updates the status and reflects in cached data and Google Sheets.
* **View Tasks**: Confirm that the displayed tasks match the sorted and filtered criteria.

### 2. Google Sheets Integration

* Validate the synchronization of task data between the application and Google Sheets.
* Test for API error handling, such as retry logic when network issues occur.

### 3. Input Validation

The application has built-in input validation methods to ensure data integrity:

* **Task Names**: Must be non-empty and under 50 characters.
* **Deadlines**: Enforced to follow the format YYYY-MM-DD and must not be in the past.
* **Priority Levels**: Restrict inputs to "High," "Medium," or "Low."
* **Project and Category IDs**: Ensure the selected IDs exist in the respective Google Sheets.

When testing, check these validation methods by deliberately entering invalid inputs to ensure the system provides appropriate error messages and does not proceed with invalid data.

### 4. Console-Based User Interface

* Test for usability in various console environments (e.g., local terminal, Heroku shell).
* Verify that table-based outputs adapt properly to the predefined CONSOLE_WIDTH.

### 5. Error Handling

* Simulate errors like invalid task IDs or failed Google Sheets updates to test how the application handles exceptions gracefully.

### 6. PEP8 validation

![PEP8_test_results](assets/ci-python-linter-test.png)

* **PEP8 Python Linter test** check the code with Code Institute's Python Linter to make sure that there are no errors or warings
* **Line limit** was kept to 79 characters in order to comply with The Python standard library.
